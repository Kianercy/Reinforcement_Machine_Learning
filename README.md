# Reinforcement_Machine_Learning

Here you find a sample of my PhD coding with MATLAB and mathematica in Reinforcement Machine Learning:

1)	Between two player ( simple online simulation )  
2)	During network formation ( bifurcation coding)

 ----------------------------------------------------------      

1) A simple MATLAB code to study a two-player  two-action game by changing exploration and exploitation  of the player using Boltzmann strategy updating. We looked  at how players strategies changes over time.

2) During my PhD study I was highly involved with non-linear dynamics and bifurcation analysis.  In one project, I worked on how decision makers (agents) simultaneously change strategy and their partners. Here you find a mathmeica code for creating the bifurcations used in this project.
